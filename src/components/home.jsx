                                Welcome! This is my personal website and portfolio used to express my life as well as show off the projects that I've been a part of or I've been currently working on!
                                I am currently focusing on and sharpening my skills in Web Development, mainly focusing on frameworks such as Bootrap, React.js and libraries such as jQuery. 
                                I do have my degree in Computer Science but I have been mainly self taught and really do enjoy the challenges of self-learning. My main focus is Web Development but I do want to 
                                explore many different aspects in programming such as developing Desktop Softwares, Mobile Applications and Web Applications. I am still a little rough around the edges in terms of coding
                                but I do really enjoy coding and being a developer and can't wait to take on new challenges. I strive to be excellent at everything I do and programming is no exception!
